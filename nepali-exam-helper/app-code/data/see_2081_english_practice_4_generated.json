The little one wore a blue frock, the other a yellow print, and both had red kerchiefs on their heads. They had just come from church when they met, and first they showed each other their finery, and then they began to play.\nSoon the fancy took them to splash about in the water, and the smaller one was going to step into the puddle, shoes and all, when the elder checked her: 'Don't go in so, Malasha,' said she, 'your mother will scold you. I will take off my shoes and stockings, and you take off yours.' They did so; and then, picking up their skirts, began walking towards each other through the puddle. The water came up to Malasha's ankles, and she said: 'It is deep, Akoulya, I am afraid!'"

When college professor, Parker Wilson (Richard Gere), discovers a rather unlikely commuter wandering around the train station, he takes the lost Akita puppy home with him. Parker and his new canine friend, Hachi, soon form a bond that cannot be broken. Hachi follows Parker to the train station every day and returns to the station every evening to greet his beloved master after work. On one very sad day, Parker leaves for work and becomes deathly ill, never to return to the station again. Even after Parker passes away, Hachi faithfully returns to the station everyday for the next nine years, until his death, to wait for his beloved master.\n\nThis film is an American adaptation of a true story set in 1925 Japan about a professor and his devoted dog. Today, a bronze statue of Hachi stands in the Shibuya Station in Japan in honour of his faithfulness and loyalty.\n\nDirector, Lasse Hallström's choice of musical score, soft piano music, enhances the film's pathos beautifully. His creative use of black and white shots shows the audience Hachi's perspective of the world around him. Richard Gere's interaction with the adorable Hachi is a joy to watch and will put a smile on your face."

We clean and decorate our houses with colourful lights and marigold garlands. On the third day, we worship Laxmi, the goddess of wealth. The most special day for me is the last day, Bhai Tika, when sisters put tika on their brothers' foreheads and pray for their long life.

            "content": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming our world, from automating tasks to revolutionizing healthcare. While the benefits are immense, the advancement of AI also brings significant challenges that society must address to ensure a responsible and equitable future.\n\nOne of the most pressing concerns is job displacement. As AI systems become more capable, many jobs, particularly those involving repetitive tasks, are at risk of being automated. This could lead to widespread unemployment and economic inequality if we do not prepare our workforce for new roles that require uniquely human skills like creativity and critical thinking.\n\nAnother significant challenge is the issue of bias and ethics. AI systems learn from the data they are trained on. If this data reflects existing societal biases, the AI can perpetuate and even amplify them, leading to unfair outcomes in areas like hiring or loan applications. Ensuring fairness and transparency in AI algorithms is a complex but crucial task.\n\nFurthermore, the misuse of AI poses a serious threat. From autonomous weapons to sophisticated cyber-attacks and the spread of misinformation through deepfakes, the potential for harm is substantial. Establishing strong regulations and international agreements is essential to mitigate these risks.\n\nIn conclusion, while we embrace the potential of AI, we must also proactively address its challenges. Investing in education, promoting ethical AI development, and creating robust regulations are necessary steps to ensure that this powerful technology benefits all of humanity."

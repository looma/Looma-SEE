          "content": "It's a late night in the Metro area of Phoenix, Arizona. Under the artificial glare of street lamps, a car can be seen slowly approaching. A green and blue 'W' glows from the windscreen, giving off just enough light to see inside - to a completely empty driver seat. This is a Waymo One robotaxi, hailed just 10 minutes ago using an app.\n\nThe promise of driverless technology has long been enticing. It has the potential to transform our experience of commuting, take people out of high-risk working environments and streamline our industries. It's key to helping us build the cities of the future, where our reliance on cars is redefined, lowering carbon emissions. And it could make our travel safer. The World Health Organization estimates that more than 1.3 million people die each year as a result of road traffic crashes.\n\nBut in order for driverless technology to become mainstream, much still needs to change. 'Driverless vehicles should be a very calm and serene way of getting from A to B. But not every human driver around it will be behaving in that way,' says David Hynd, a chief scientist. 'It's got to be able to cope with human drivers speeding, for instance, or breaking the rules of the road.' And that's not the only challenge. There's regulation, rethinking the Highway Code, public perception, and the big question of ultimate liability for road accidents."

          "content": "Today, the world's population is more than three times larger than it was in the mid-twentieth century. It took around 37 years since 1950 for human numbers to double, surpassing 5 billion inhabitants in 1987. Since 1965, the pace of population growth has slowed by more than half owing to reduced levels of fertility. In 2020, the rate of population growth fell below one percent per year and it is projected to continue to slow.\n\nThe world's two most populous regions in 2022 were Eastern and South-Eastern Asia (2.3 billion people) and Central and Southern Asia (2.1 billion people). China and India accounted for the largest populations in these regions, with more than 1.4 billion each in 2022. However, Central and Southern Asia is expected to become the most populous region by 2037.\n\nBetween 2022 and 2050, the population of sub-Saharan Africa is expected to almost double, surpassing two billion inhabitants by the late 2040s. With average fertility levels remaining high, sub-Saharan Africa is projected to account for more than half of the growth of the world's population between 2022 and 2050.\n\nMore than half of the projected increase in the global population up to 2050 is expected to be concentrated in just eight countries: The Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines and the United Republic of Tanzania. Disparate population growth rates among the world's largest countries will change their ranking by size: For example, India is projected to surpass China as the world's most populous country in 2023."

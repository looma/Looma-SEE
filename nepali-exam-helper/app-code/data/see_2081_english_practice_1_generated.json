          "content": "Modern life is fundamentally intertwined with the internet. Nearly every daily task now has the opportunity for online integration, and almost everyone owns multiple devices, including laptops, phones, tablets, and smartwatches. The more accounts and devices you have online, the greater the potential is for criminals to access your personal information and take advantage of you.\n\nOnline safety is important no matter your age or life stage, but there are particular concerns for certain vulnerable groups like children, teenagers, and senior citizens. When it comes to internet safety, it's best to start with the basics. Here are some tips to guide you.\n\nWhile creating a new password, pay attention to strong password requirements. Use different user IDs or password combinations for different accounts. Make the password more complicated by combining letters, numbers, and special characters and create hard-to-guess passwords. Change your passwords quite often. Don't share your passwords with other people. Record passwords in an encrypted file on your computer, or select another secure password storage method. Avoid writing them down. Prevent \"auto-login\" by unchecking \"Keep me signed in\" and \"Remember my password\" options.\n\nIt's also important to protect your personal information offline. Remember tips like shielding the personal identification number (PIN) pad when you make purchases. Using a chip debit card is another way to protect your financial information. The more sophisticated chip technology is just one reason why the chip card is more secure than the traditional magnetic strip debit card. When you sign up for something online, always read the terms and conditions. Never enter your financial information on a website that is not secure.\n\nFinally, enable two-factor authentication in order to prevent hackers from accessing your personal accounts and information. Add the extra layer of security to keep your accounts safe even if someone knows your password."

          "content": "It’s a topic that’s never out of the media, with endless variations on whether carbs, fat, sugar or protein are good or bad, or reports on the latest wonderfood that will help us live longer. We are now relying on science and innovation to help us tackle the new public health challenge that is diet and lifestyle-related diseases such as overweight and obesity.\n\nIt's a challenge that many countries are facing. In the last three decades, the levels of overweight and obesity have risen dramatically, particularly among children, and the trend of poor diet and low physical activity is getting even worse. Many chronic conditions such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, obesity and type 2 diabetes can be prevented or modified through better lifestyles and healthier diets.\n\nUnfortunately, different attempts to encourage healthier eating have not yet led to major changes in patterns of food purchase and consumption. That's where a multidisciplinary approach comes in, with health and nutrition research that includes the social sciences. We all know, for example, that understanding people's behaviours and their relationship to food and exercise is vital in helping them to make healthier choices.\n\nImplementation is important, and this will be achieved first by coordinating national research programmes and activities. In this critical phase of implementation, it is important to unlock national funding for research and to actively engage in aligning national research programmes and innovation policies."

          "content": "In today's fast-paced world, there is a growing trend among young people to choose fast food over traditional home-cooked meals. This shift is largely driven by convenience, attractive advertising, and the influence of western culture. Fast food restaurants offer quick service, which is appealing to students and young professionals with busy schedules. Additionally, the taste and variety of items like pizza, burgers, and fried chicken are often perceived as more exciting than traditional dishes like 'dal-bhat'. Peer pressure and the desire to socialize in popular fast-food joints also contribute significantly to this trend.\n\nHowever, the increasing consumption of fast food has several negative effects on the health and culture of our youth. These foods are typically high in calories, unhealthy fats, sugar, and salt, while being low in essential nutrients. Regular consumption can lead to serious health problems like obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. Furthermore, this trend is causing a decline in the appreciation for our own rich and healthy culinary traditions. The practice of families eating together, which is a cornerstone of our culture, is also diminishing as more young people prefer to eat out with friends.

The story chronicles the author's life as a person born with cerebral palsy in a rural Nepali village. Unable to speak, walk, or use her hands, Ghimire learns to write with her left foot, defying all societal expectations and physical limitations to become a celebrated writer. The plot is not just a sequence of events but a profound journey of her struggle, determination, and ultimate triumph against immense adversity.\n\nThe greatest strength of the book is its raw and honest narration. Ghimire does not shy away from depicting the pain, neglect, and discrimination she faced, which makes her achievements even more remarkable. Her writing is simple yet deeply moving, allowing readers to connect with her struggles on a personal level. The vivid descriptions of her village life and family dynamics add a rich cultural context. A potential weakness for some readers might be the intense emotional weight of the story; it is a difficult and often heartbreaking read.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend Jivan Kada Ki Phul to everyone. It is more than just an autobiography; it is a testament to the unbeatable power of the human spirit. The book teaches us about resilience, the importance of education, and the need for empathy.

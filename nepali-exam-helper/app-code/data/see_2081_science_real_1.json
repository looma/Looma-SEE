          "sampleAnswer": "**Principle of Conservation of Energy:** This principle states that energy can neither be created nor be destroyed; it can only be transformed from one form to another. The total energy in an isolated system remains constant.\n\n**Verification for a Freely Falling Body:**\nConsider a body of mass 'm' at a height 'h' (position A). \n1.  **At Position A (at height h):** Kinetic Energy (KE) = 0. Potential Energy (PE) = mgh. Total Energy (TE) = KE + PE = **mgh**.\n2.  **At Position B (after falling a distance x):** Height = h - x. From v² = u² + 2as, v² = 2gx. So KE = ½m(2gx) = mgx. PE = mg(h-x) = mgh - mgx. TE = KE + PE = mgx + mgh - mgx = **mgh**.\n3.  **At Position C (just before hitting the ground):** Height = 0. So, PE = 0. From v² = u² + 2as, v² = 2gh. KE = ½m(2gh) = mgh. TE = KE + PE = mgh + 0 = **mgh**.\nSince the total energy at all points is the same (mgh), the principle is verified. The potential energy is converted into kinetic energy during the fall."

These plaques can rupture and form a blood clot, blocking blood flow.\n2.  **High Blood Pressure (Hypertension):** Uncontrolled high blood pressure can damage arteries, making them more susceptible to atherosclerosis. It also forces the heart to work harder.\n\n**Preventive Measures for Heart Attack:**\n1.  **Healthy Diet:** Adopting a balanced diet low in saturated fats, trans fats, cholesterol, and sodium is crucial. A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains helps manage blood pressure and cholesterol.\n2.  **Regular Physical Activity:** Engaging in regular aerobic exercise (like brisk walking or swimming) strengthens the heart, improves circulation, and helps control weight, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels."

The gravitational force (F) is directly proportional to the product of the masses: F ∝ m₁m₂.\n2. The force (F) is inversely proportional to the square of the distance: F ∝ 1/d².\nCombining these, we get: F ∝ (m₁m₂)/d².\nTo make this an equation, we introduce the Universal Gravitational Constant, G.\nTherefore, **F = G(m₁m₂)/d²**, where G is a constant of proportionality."

They act as the carriers of genetic information. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, inheriting one of each pair from each parent. Chromosomes ensure that genetic information is accurately organized and distributed during cell division and reproduction.\n\n**Role of Genes:**\nA gene is a specific segment of DNA on a chromosome. It is the fundamental unit of heredity. Each gene contains the instructions (code) to produce a specific protein. These proteins determine the specific traits of an organism, such as eye color, height, or blood type. Different versions of a gene, called alleles, are inherited from parents, and their combination determines the final expressed trait."

The way he came to the throne is very interesting and controversial at the same time. He had the experience of administration even when his father was alive. When his father Laxmi Nara Singh's madness grew worse, he imprisoned his father and he himself ruled as a regent of his father in Kantipur.\n\nHe was an able administrator. Kantipur was highly developed during his reign. Trade with Lhasa (Tibet) was also going on well. By his tact he was making the kings of Lalitpur and Bhaktapur play against each other. Sometimes he sided with Bhaktapur and posed a threat to Lalitpur. On other occasions, he aligned with Lalitpur and fell upon Bhaktapur.\n\nPratap Malla was a religious-minded person. He built a beautiful temple at Guhyeshwari and fenced it. He renovated the temple of Pashupatinath and raised a pinnacle over it. At Swayambhu he built Pratappur, Kabeendrapur and many other temples and also set up a copper gilt 'Bajra'. He also renovated the temples and Basuki Bhimsen, Taleju and Degutale. With a view to warding off evils, he erected an image of Hanuman, the monkey god, by the side of his palace gate and called the palace Hanumandhoka. He erected the golden gate of the palace, set up an image of Nri Simha, Kal Bhairab and Vishwaroop at Layaku Bahi. Inside the palace, he also set up Sundari Chowk and Mohan Chowk. A pond was dug at Bhandarkhal and filled with water brought from Budhanilkantha. He installed an image of Narayan lying in the pond, an exact replica from Budhanilkantha Temple."

          "content": "Nobel Prize is any of the prizes (five in number until 1969, when a sixth was added) awarded annually from a fund bequeathed for that purpose by the Swedish inventor and industrialist Alfred Nobel. The Nobel Prizes are widely regarded as the world's most prestigious awards for intellectual achievement.\n\nIn his will drafted in 1895, Nobel instructed that most of his fortune be set aside as a fund for the awarding of five annual prizes \"to those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind?\" These prizes as established by his will are the Nobel Prize for Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, Literature and Peace respectively.\n\nThe first distribution of the prizes took place on December 10, 1901, the fifth anniversary of Nobel's death. An additional award, in Economic Sciences in memory of Alfred Nobel, was established in 1968 by the Bank of Sweden and was first awarded in 1969. Although not technically a Nobel Prize, it is identified with the award; its winners are announced with the Nobel Prize recipients and the Prize in Economic Sciences is presented at the Nobel Prize Award Ceremony.\n\nAfter Nobel's death, the Nobel Foundation was set up to carry out the provisions of his will and to administer his funds. In his will, he had stipulated that four different institutions three Swedish and one Norwegian should award the prizes. From Stockholm, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences confers the prizes for Physics, Chemistry and Economic Sciences, the Karolinska Institute confers the prize for Physiology or Medicine, and the Swedish Academy confers the prize for Literature. The Norwegian Nobel Committee based on Oslo, Norway confers the prize for peace. The Nobel Foundation is the legal owner and functional administrator of the funds and serves as the joint administrative body of the price awarding institutions, but it is not concerned with prize deliberations or decisions."

I was delighted to receive your letter and to know that you are keen on improving your English. Since I am studying here in an English-speaking environment, I can definitely share some tips that have helped me.\n\nFirst and foremost, immersion is key. Try to surround yourself with the language as much as possible. You can do this by watching English movies, listening to English songs, or even listening to podcasts on topics you enjoy. This helps with listening skills and pronunciation.\n\nSecondly, reading is incredibly beneficial. Start with simple storybooks or newspapers and gradually move to novels. This will expand your vocabulary and help you understand sentence structures. Don't be afraid to speak, even if you make mistakes. Practice speaking with your friends or even in front of a mirror.\n\nFinally, writing a diary in English every day is a great habit. It forces you to think in English. Consistency is the secret. Dedicate at least 30 minutes every day to practice.\n\nI am sure with your dedication, you will master the language in no time. Keep working hard!\n\nWith love,\nYour brother,\nSuren",

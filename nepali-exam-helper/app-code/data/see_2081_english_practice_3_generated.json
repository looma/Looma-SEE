The way he came to the throne is very interesting and controversial. When his father Laxmi Nara Singh's madness grew worse, he imprisoned his father and ruled as a regent in Kantipur.\n\nHe was an able administrator. Kantipur was highly developed during his reign. By his tact, he was making the kings of Lalitpur and Bhaktapur play against each other. Sometimes he sided with Bhaktapur and posed a threat to Lalitpur. On other occasions, he aligned with Lalitpur and fell upon Bhaktapur.\n\nPratap Malla was a religious-minded person. He built a beautiful temple at Guhyeshwari and renovated the temple of Pashupatinath, raising a pinnacle over it. At Swayambhu he built Pratappur and Kabeendrapur. With a view to warding off evils, he erected an image of Hanuman by the side of his palace gate and called the palace Hanumandhoka. He also set up Sundari Chowk and Mohan Chowk inside the palace. A pond was dug at Bhandarkhal and filled with water brought from Budhanilakantha. He installed an image of Narayan lying in the pond, an exact replica from Budhanilakantha Temple.\n\nPratap Malla was also a vastly-learned king and a poet. He could compose poems in many languages and conferred on himself the title of 'Kabeendra', a king of poets."

          "content": "Thanksgiving is celebrated to extend thanks for the harvest. Even though it seems uniquely American, the tradition is followed in different countries in various forms.\n\nThanksgiving, USA: Celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November, it commemorates the feast the Pilgrims held after the first harvest in 1621. Roast turkey is essential. Parades are a big part of the celebrations too, like Macy's Thanksgiving parade in New York.\n\nChuseok, South Korea: Also called Hangawi, it is celebrated on the 15th day of August, according to the lunar calendar, to commemorate the fall harvest and to honour one's ancestors. The food most associated with the holiday is songpyeon, a crescent-shaped rice cake. Other activities include tug-of-war competitions and archery contests.\n\nDia de Acao de Gracas, Brazil: Established in 1949 after President Gaspar Dutra visited the USA, it begins with a mass to offer thanks for an abundant harvest, then there is a vibrant carnival and revellers head to the beach. Roasted turkey is the centrepiece, but a sauce made of Jaboticaba, the 'Brazilian grape', is used instead of cranberry sauce.\n\nHomowo, Ghana: This festival, meaning 'to jeer or hoot at hunger', historically celebrates the ending of a long famine. Palm nut soup with fish is served alongside traditional Kpokoi. The festival culminates in a night of singing and dancing and frantic beating of drums in loud defiance of hunger and famine.\n\nMehregan, Iran: A festival that dates back to the 4th century BC, it celebrates a successful harvest and the goddess Mehr. The celebration calls for new clothes and a feast on a table decorated with marjoram. Revellers rub kohl around their eyes as a good omen."

The primary causes for this exodus are the pursuit of better educational opportunities, higher-paying jobs, and a more stable political and economic environment. In Nepal, limited university placements, a lack of specialized courses, and widespread unemployment push our brightest minds to seek their future abroad. The allure of a better quality of life and global exposure, often glamorized through social media, further fuels this ambition.\n\nWhile migration can bring benefits like remittances, which are a lifeline for Nepal's economy, its negative effects are alarming. The most critical impact is 'brain drain', the loss of skilled and educated individuals who are essential for the country's development in sectors like healthcare, engineering, and technology. This creates a vacuum of expertise and hinders national progress. Socially, it leads to separated families and an aging population in rural areas.

Heaps of waste can be seen piled up on roadsides and in open spaces, creating a very unhygienic environment. The foul smell emanating from the rotting garbage has made it difficult for residents to even walk on the streets. This situation poses a severe threat to public health, as it has become a breeding ground for flies, mosquitoes, and other disease-carrying pests. We fear an outbreak of diseases like cholera and dengue if immediate action is not taken.\n\nThe environmental impact is also concerning, with plastic waste clogging drains and polluting our surroundings. I suggest that the municipality should ensure regular and timely garbage collection. Placing more dustbins at various points and launching awareness campaigns about proper waste disposal could also be effective solutions. I hope the authorities will wake up from their slumber and take necessary steps to address this pressing issue.\n\nYours truly,\n(Your Name)\nA concerned resident of Koteshwor",

          "title": "Walt Disney: An Example of Struggle and Success",
          "content": "Walt Disney is known as an extraordinarily successful and creative person whose visions as an animator, filmmaker, and theme park developer changed the entertainment world. Yet, dig a little deeper into Disney's background, and you will discover that his road to success was paved by an unhappy childhood along with countless business failures and setbacks.\n\nBorn in Chicago in 1901 and raised in Missouri, Disney was the fourth son among five siblings. His father, Elias, was a domineering figure who was allegedly abusive. To escape from his stressful circumstances, Young Disney found solace in drawing. When Disney was 16, he dropped out of school to join the Army but was rejected for being underage. Instead, he joined the Red Cross and was sent to France for a year to drive an ambulance.\n\nWhen he returned home, Disney became an apprentice at a Kansas City commercial art studio. He and his older brother, Roy, launched their own cartoon business, Laugh-O-Gram Studios, in 1920, but the company went bankrupt a couple of years later. With the loss of his first business, Disney packed his bags, and with just forty dollars to his name, took off to Los Angeles to try his hand at acting. But he failed at that, too."

'Setback' is a general term for the many failures he faced.\nব্যাখ্যা (Nepali Explanation): अर्थहरू पाठको सन्दर्भसँग मेल खान्छन्: 'Domineering' ले उसको बुबाको नियन्त्रण गर्ने स्वभावको वर्णन गर्दछ। 'Solace' ले चित्रकलामा पाएको सान्त्वनालाई जनाउँछ। 'Apprentice' घर फर्केपछिको उसको पहिलो काम थियो। 'Bankrupt' ले उसको पहिलो कम्पनीको असफलताको वर्णन गर्दछ। 'Setback' उसले सामना गरेका धेरै असफलताहरूको लागि एक सामान्य शब्द हो।"

The global population is estimated to double again in about 70 years, rising to over 10 billion by 2059.\n\nSince 1950, the pace of population growth has slowed by more than half owing to reduced levels of fertility. In 2020, the rate of population growth fell below one percent per year and it is projected to continue to slow. The global population could grow to around 8.5 billion in 2030, and 9.7 billion in 2050.\n\nThe world's two most populous regions in 2022 were Eastern and South-Eastern Asia (2.3 billion people) and Central and Southern Asia (2.1 billion people). China and India accounted for the largest populations in these regions, with more than 1.4 billion each in 2022. Between 2022 and 2050, the population of sub-Saharan Africa is expected to almost double, surpassing two billion inhabitants by the late 2040s.\n\nMore than half of the projected increase in the global population between 2022 and 2050 is expected to be concentrated in just eight countries: The Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines and the United Republic of Tanzania. India is projected to surpass China as the world's most populous country in 2023."

However, cultivating hobbies and interests outside of schoolwork is crucial for holistic development and overall well-being. Hobbies are not just pastimes; they are essential tools for growth.\n\nFirstly, hobbies are an excellent way to relieve stress. Engaging in an activity one loves, whether it is painting, playing a musical instrument, or gardening, can be a great escape from academic pressure. This mental break helps students to refresh their minds and return to their studies with renewed focus and energy. Secondly, hobbies help in discovering and nurturing hidden talents. A student might discover a passion for photography or writing, which could even turn into a future career.\n\nMoreover, hobbies teach valuable life skills. Team sports, for instance, teach cooperation, leadership, and discipline. Pursuing interests like coding or debating enhances problem-solving and communication skills. These are skills that are not always taught in a traditional classroom but are vital for success in life.\n\nIn conclusion, encouraging students to have hobbies is as important as focusing on their academic performance. These interests contribute to their mental health, skill development, and personal happiness, shaping them into well-rounded and successful individuals."

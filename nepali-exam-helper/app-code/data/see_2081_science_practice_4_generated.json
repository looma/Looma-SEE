          "marks": 2,
          "sampleAnswer": "In a pressure cooker, the steam produced from boiling water is trapped inside, which increases the pressure above the water's surface. This increased pressure raises the boiling point of water above 100°C. Since the food is cooked at a higher temperature, the chemical reactions involved in cooking happen faster, significantly reducing the cooking time."

The maximum upthrust occurs when the object is fully submerged. This condition also means the density of the object is greater than the density of the fluid.\n    * Condition: **W > U**\n\n2.  **Object Floats on the Surface:** An object will float on the surface of the fluid if its weight (W) is less than the maximum upthrust (U) available when fully submerged. The object will sink only until the upthrust becomes exactly equal to its weight, leaving part of it above the fluid surface.\n    * Condition: **W < U**\n\n3.  **Object Floats Fully Submerged:** An object will float while being fully submerged within the fluid (remaining suspended at any depth) if its weight (W) is exactly equal to the maximum upthrust (U) when it is fully submerged. This condition means the density of the object is equal to the density of the fluid.\n    * Condition: **W = U**"

This is achieved by the iron-containing protein called hemoglobin, which binds to oxygen and also gives blood its red color. They also carry some carbon dioxide back to the lungs.\n\n2.  **White Blood Cells (WBCs) / Leucocytes (सेता रक्तकोष):**\n    * **Function:** They are the main components of the body's immune system. Their function is to identify and destroy foreign invaders like bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites, thereby protecting the body from diseases and infections. Some WBCs produce antibodies, while others engulf pathogens directly.\n\n3.  **Platelets / Thrombocytes (प्लेटलेट्स):**\n    * **Function:** Platelets play a crucial role in hemostasis, which is the process of stopping bleeding. When a blood vessel is injured, platelets gather at the site, stick together to form a temporary plug, and release chemicals that initiate the complex process of blood clotting."

          "marks": 4,
          "sampleAnswer": "**(i) Sodium is kept in kerosene:** Sodium is a highly reactive alkali metal. It reacts vigorously with both oxygen and moisture present in the air, which can cause it to catch fire. It is kept in kerosene because kerosene is an organic liquid with which sodium does not react, and it prevents the metal from coming into contact with air and water.\n\n**(ii) Blue color of copper sulphate fades:** Iron is more reactive than copper according to the reactivity series. When an iron nail is placed in a blue copper sulphate (CuSO₄) solution, the more reactive iron displaces the copper from the solution, forming a pale green solution of iron sulphate (FeSO₄) and depositing reddish-brown copper on the nail. As the blue copper ions are removed from the solution, the blue color fades.\n\n**(iii) Diamond shines brightly:** Diamond shines due to its high refractive index and the phenomenon of total internal reflection. Light entering a properly cut diamond undergoes multiple total internal reflections from its inner faces before emerging. This traps the light for a moment and causes it to disperse into its constituent colors, giving diamond its characteristic sparkle.\n\n**(iv) Water pipes burst in winter:** This is due to the anomalous expansion of water. As water cools, it contracts until 4°C, but upon further cooling to 0°C and freezing, it expands in volume by about 9%. When water inside a pipe freezes, this expansion exerts an immense pressure on the walls of the pipe, causing it to burst."

          "sampleAnswer": "**Food Preservation:** Food preservation is the process of treating and handling food in a way to stop or greatly slow down spoilage (loss of quality, edibility, or nutritional value) caused by the growth of microorganisms.\n\n**Three Traditional Methods:**\n1.  **Drying/Dehydration (सुकाउने):** This is one of the oldest methods. It involves removing water or moisture from food, as microorganisms need water to grow. In Nepal, vegetables (like gundruk), fruits, and meat are often preserved by drying them in the sun. The lack of moisture inhibits the growth of bacteria, yeasts, and molds.\n2.  **Pickling (अचार बनाउने):** This method involves preserving food in an edible antimicrobial liquid. This is typically done using vinegar (which is acidic) or brine (a strong salt solution). The high acidity or high salt concentration creates an environment where most spoilage-causing microbes cannot survive. Vegetables like mango, radish, and lime are commonly pickled.\n3.  **Use of Oil and Spices:** Storing food completely submerged in oil creates an anaerobic environment, cutting off the oxygen supply required by many spoilage microorganisms. Many spices, like turmeric and mustard, also have natural antimicrobial properties that help in preservation. This method is often combined with pickling."

          "marks": 4,
          "sampleAnswer": "**Role of the Liver (कलेजो):**\nThe liver is a vital accessory organ of digestion. Its main roles are producing bile and processing nutrients.\n1.  **Production of Bile:** The liver produces bile, which is stored in the gallbladder and released into the small intestine. Bile emulsifies fats, breaking down large fat globules into smaller droplets, which increases the surface area for lipase enzymes to act upon and digest the fat.\n2.  **Metabolism of Nutrients:** After absorption from the small intestine, nutrient-rich blood goes to the liver for processing. The liver metabolizes carbohydrates (storing glucose as glycogen), proteins, and fats. It also detoxifies harmful substances absorbed from the food.\n\n**Role of the Pancreas (प्यान्क्रियाज):**\nThe pancreas has both exocrine and endocrine functions, but its digestive role is exocrine.\n1.  **Production of Pancreatic Juice:** The pancreas produces pancreatic juice, which contains a variety of powerful digestive enzymes. These include amylase (to digest carbohydrates), lipase (to digest fats), and proteases like trypsin and chymotrypsin (to digest proteins).\n2.  **Neutralization of Stomach Acid:** Pancreatic juice is alkaline because it contains bicarbonate ions. When it is secreted into the duodenum, it neutralizes the acidic chyme coming from the stomach, creating the optimal alkaline environment required for the pancreatic and intestinal enzymes to function effectively."

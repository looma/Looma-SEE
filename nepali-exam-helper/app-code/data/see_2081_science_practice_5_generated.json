Let a force 'F' be applied for time 't' so that its final velocity is 'v'.\nInitial momentum = mu. Final momentum = mv.\nChange in momentum = mv - mu = m(v-u).\nRate of change of momentum = m(v-u)/t.\nAccording to the law, F ∝ m(v-u)/t. Since acceleration a = (v-u)/t, we have F ∝ ma. \nBy choosing a suitable unit for force, the constant of proportionality becomes 1. Thus, F = ma."

          "sampleAnswer": "**Double Circulation:**\nThe circulation in the human heart is called double circulation because the blood passes through the heart twice for each complete circuit of the body. The heart acts as a double pump, with the right side handling deoxygenated blood and the left side handling oxygenated blood in two separate circuits.\n\n**Pulmonary Circulation:**\nThis is the circuit that carries deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs and brings oxygenated blood back to the heart.\n1.  Deoxygenated blood from the body enters the right atrium and is pumped into the right ventricle.\n2.  The right ventricle pumps this deoxygenated blood into the pulmonary artery, which carries it to the lungs.\n3.  In the lungs, the blood releases carbon dioxide and picks up oxygen.\n4.  This newly oxygenated blood returns to the left atrium of the heart via the pulmonary vein.\n\n**Systemic Circulation:**\nThis is the circuit that carries oxygenated blood from the heart to the rest of the body and returns deoxygenated blood back to the heart.\n1.  Oxygenated blood from the lungs enters the left atrium and is pumped into the left ventricle.\n2.  The powerful left ventricle pumps this oxygenated blood into the aorta.\n3.  The aorta branches into smaller arteries, supplying oxygen and nutrients to all body tissues.\n4.  Deoxygenated blood, now carrying waste products, is collected by veins and returns to the right atrium of the heart through the vena cava, completing the circuit."

          "marks": 4,
          "sampleAnswer": "**(i) Weight on the Moon is less:** The weight of an object (W=mg) depends on the acceleration due to gravity (g). The Moon has significantly less mass and a smaller radius than the Earth, resulting in a much weaker gravitational pull (about 1/6th of Earth's). Therefore, the value of 'g' on the Moon is less, and the object's weight is consequently less.\n\n**(ii) We see only one side of the Moon:** This is due to 'synchronous rotation' or 'tidal locking'. The Moon rotates on its axis in exactly the same amount of time it takes to revolve once around the Earth. As a result, the same hemisphere of the Moon constantly faces the Earth.\n\n**(iii) Stars twinkle:** Stars appear to twinkle because their light has to travel through the Earth's turbulent atmosphere. The constantly moving layers of air have varying densities and temperatures, which cause the starlight to refract or bend multiple times before it reaches our eyes. This continuous bending makes the star's apparent position and brightness fluctuate, which we perceive as twinkling.\n\n**(iv) Sound travels farther in winter:** In winter, the air near the ground is colder and denser than the air above it. Sound travels slower in colder, denser air. This difference in speed causes the sound waves to refract or bend downwards towards the ground, allowing them to travel a greater distance along the surface before dissipating."

          "marks": 4,
          "sampleAnswer": "**Anomalous Expansion of Water:**\nMost substances contract continuously when cooled. Water, however, behaves unusually. It contracts as it cools until it reaches a temperature of 4°C. Upon further cooling from 4°C to 0°C, it starts to expand instead of contracting. This unusual expansion of water when cooled between 4°C and 0°C is known as the anomalous expansion of water. Because of this, water has its maximum density at 4°C, and ice at 0°C is less dense than the water at 4°C.\n\n**Benefit to Aquatic Animals:**\nThis unique property is crucial for the survival of aquatic life in cold climates.\n1.  As the temperature of a lake or pond drops during winter, the surface water cools, becomes denser, and sinks. This process continues until all the water in the lake reaches 4°C.\n2.  As the surface water cools further below 4°C, it becomes less dense due to anomalous expansion. Therefore, this colder water (at 3°C, 2°C, 1°C) remains on top.\n3.  At 0°C, the surface water freezes into ice, which is even less dense, so it floats on the surface.\n4.  This top layer of ice acts as an insulator, preventing the heat from the water below from escaping into the cold atmosphere. This ensures that the water at the bottom of the lake remains at 4°C, allowing fish and other aquatic animals to survive in the liquid water below the ice."

Set daily time limits for specific applications, especially social media and games, to prevent excessive use.\n\n2.  **Establish 'No-Tech' Zones and Times:** Designate certain times of the day (e.g., during meals, an hour before bed) or certain physical areas (e.g., the bedroom) as technology-free zones. This helps in being more present in the real world and improves sleep quality.\n\n3.  **Curate Your Digital Content:** Actively manage what you see online. Unfollow accounts or mute conversations that cause stress, anxiety, or negativity. Prioritize content that is informative, positive, and aligns with your goals and hobbies.\n\n4.  **Practice Digital Detoxing:** Regularly schedule periods of time, from a few hours to a full day or weekend, to completely disconnect from all digital devices. This allows your mind to rest and reset, reduces digital fatigue, and encourages engagement in offline activities."

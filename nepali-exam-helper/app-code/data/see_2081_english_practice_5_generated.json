          "content": "Two little girls from different houses happened to meet in a lane. The dirty water after running through the farm-yards had formed a large puddle. One girl was very small, the other a little bigger. Their mothers had dressed them both in new frocks.\n\nSoon the fancy took them to splash about in the water, and the smaller one was going to step into the puddle, shoes and all, when the elder checked her: 'Don't go in so, Malasha,' said she, 'your mother will scold you. I will take off my shoes and stockings, and you take off yours.'\n\nThey did so; and then, picking up their skirts, began walking towards each other through the puddle. When they got near one another, Akoulya said: 'Mind, Malasha, don't splash. Walk carefully!' She had hardly said this, when Malasha plumped down her foot so that the water splashed right on to Akoulya's frock. The frock was splashed, and so were Akoulya's eyes and nose. When she saw the stains on her frock, she was angry and ran after Malasha to strike her.\n\nJust then Akoulya's mother happened to be passing, and seeing her daughter's skirt was splashed, she seized Malasha, and struck her. Malasha began to howl. Her mother came out and began scolding her neighbour. One word led to another and they had an angry quarrel. The men came out, and a crowd collected, everyone shouting. They all went on quarreling, till Akoulya's old grandmother tried to calm them. But they would not listen. While the women were abusing each other, Akoulya had wiped the mud off her frock, and gone back to the puddle. She took a stone and began scraping away the earth to make a channel. Presently Malasha joined her, and with a chip of wood helped her dig the channel. The little girls ran straight into the group of men. The old woman, seeing them, said to the men: 'Are you not ashamed of yourselves? To go fighting on account of these lassies, when they themselves have forgotten all about it, and are playing happily together. Dear little souls! They are wiser than you!'"

          "content": "Flowers are a staple item in the gift-giving world. Flower etiquette, in Russia, is strictly guided by a range of rules depending on the setting. If flowers are gifted outside these rules, it is possible to offend the receiver.\n\nRed carnations are filled with a deep sense of patriotism, originating from the 1917 February Revolution. In contrast, white carnations represent bad omens and are believed to strip holders of good luck and talent.\n\nIn Russian culture, yellow flowers symbolise sadness and dishonesty. Therefore, giving a bunch of yellow flowers to a beloved one represents an inevitable break-up. This is famously represented in the break-up song called 'yellow tulips.'\n\nChamomile is the national flower of Russia. Its slender white petals encapsulate a bright yellow centre. Russians believe that chamomile, in the form of tea and aromatherapy, offers a vast range of medical benefits. A lesser-known belief suggests that the chamomile is a mosquito and fly repellent. Among women, chamomile holds a fortune-telling function. The self-murmured pattern of 'he loves me, he loves me not' is repeated until the last petal is plucked.\n\nThe white calla lily is an elegant flower. However, bringing a white lily bouquet to a Russian wedding would not be a good idea. These flowers symbolise death and are believed to foreshadow the split of the newly-wed couple."

          "content": "Like marathon runners, birds pace themselves so they do not run out of energy before they can land. They are always adjusting speed, height and flight path to account for changing winds, their own weight, and storms. In the spring, they retrace their paths back to their summer homes. Each fall, about five billion birds migrate south for the winter from North America. Nearly all 500 of the 650 species of North American birds migrate. Yet this is just one small part of the picture. More than half of all the bird species in the world-approximately 5,000 species- migrate, and each species is on a different journey.\n\nOther animal species also migrate, including insects, amphibians, reptiles, fish and mammals. Migration is happening all the time: Herds of wild beast arrive every January at green pastures in the Southern Serengeti of Africa. Swarms of free tailed bats arrive each March to caves in Texas. Northern fur seals gather on Alaskan islands each June. In September, Chinook salmon swim up rivers in Washington State. If you are in the right place at the right time, you can witness these amazing journeys. Yet, no matter where you live, you can see some birds migrating. In fact, much of what we know about migration comes from studying birds."

          "content": "By MyKhel Staff, December 21\nJanakpur Bolts clinched the first ever Nepal Premier League after a thumping 5-wicket win over Sudurpaschim Royals in the final at the TU International Stadium in Kirtipur on Saturday. Lahiru Milantha smashed a 49-ball 87 as Janakpur Bolts made light work of the run chase of 185 against Sudurpaschim Royals. Milantha and skipper Aasif Sheikh (33 off 19 balls) shared a 73-run stand for the first wicket in seven overs to lay the foundation for a smooth run chase. After the two openers departed and the wickets fell at the other end, Harsh Thaker (30* off 24 balls) remained unbeaten alongside Mayan Yadav (2* off 3 balls) to see the team home with four balls to spare. For Royals, Scott Kuggeleijn, Saif Zaib and Ishan Pandey claimed a wicket each in a losing cause.\n\nEarlier opting to bat first, Sudurpaschim Royals got off to a great start as openers Saif Zaib (69 off 43 balls) and Binod Bhandari (41 off 31 balls) added 117 runs from 72 balls for the first wicket before Lalit Rajbanshi broke the stand, leading to successive dismissals in the space of 3 deliveries. Destined for a total above 200, Janakpur Bolts struck in regular intervals through Mohammed Mohsin (3 for 40) and Kishor Mahato (3 for 25) to keep the Royals down to 184/9 in their allotted 20 overs. With this, Janakpur Bolts defeated the Sudurpaschim for the first time, having lost to the table-toppers twice earlier in the tournament. The final marked the close of the first edition of the Nepal Premier League (NPL)."

          "content": "Pushpa Basnet, born in 1984 in Kathmandu, Nepal, is a Nepali social worker and the founder/president of Early Childhood Development Center (ECDC) and Butterfly Home, non-profit organizations in Kathmandu, Nepal. Her organization works to strengthen the rights of children living behind bars with their incarcerated parents. Her efforts have been recognized by national and international media since she was nominated for CNN Heroes Award which she subsequently won in 2012. She has won the super Hero Award in 2016.\n\nBasnet started her career at the age of 21, while she was still an undergraduate in social work at St. Xavier's College, Kathmandu. As part of her college assignment, she visited the women in prison in Kathmandu. She was dismayed when she saw children with their parents behind the bars. She raised 70,000 rupees from her close friends and sister, and started a non-profit organization - The Early Childhood Development Center (ECDC) to provide a day care program to the children in 2005.\n\nIn 2007, she opened a residential home for kids to live outside the prison year around while still visiting their mothers on holidays. Today, she has assisted more than 137 children of incarcerated parents. She runs a day care center for the prison children and a residential home for older ones. She has also helped to provide alternative residence, school enrollment, free meals and medical care to them.\n\nBasnet has been awarded with CNN Hero Award 2012, which was held at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, California, on Sunday, 2nd December. Academy Award winning actress Susan Sarandon presented Basnet with the award. The show was aired LIVE through CNN.\n\nWhen earlier interviewed by CNN, she commented on her venture as: \"It is not fair for (these) children to live in the prison because they have not done anything wrong ... My mission is to make sure no child grows up behind prison walls.\""

          "content": "In recent years, the consumption of junk food has skyrocketed, becoming a staple in the diet of many, especially the youth. While these foods are tasty and convenient, they pose a significant threat to human health. Junk food is typically defined as food that is high in calories from sugar or fat, with little dietary fiber, protein, vitamins, minerals, or other important forms of nutritional value.\n\nThe most immediate effect of consuming junk food is weight gain and obesity. These foods are calorie-dense but nutrient-poor, leading to an excessive intake of energy that the body stores as fat. Obesity opens the door to a host of other chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and hypertension. The high sodium content in processed foods can raise blood pressure, putting strain on the heart.\n\nFurthermore, junk food can negatively impact mental health. Studies have suggested a link between poor diet and depression or anxiety. The lack of essential nutrients affects brain function and energy levels, leading to fatigue and poor concentration. To maintain a healthy life, it is crucial to limit the intake of junk food and opt for a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Health is wealth, and we must not compromise it for momentary taste.",

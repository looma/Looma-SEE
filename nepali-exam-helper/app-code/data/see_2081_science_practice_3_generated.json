          "marks": 2,
          "sampleAnswer": "The weight of an object decreases for two main reasons:\n1. **Earth's Shape:** The Earth is not a perfect sphere; it is slightly flattened at the poles and bulges at the equator. This means the equatorial radius is greater than the polar radius. Since gravity (and thus weight) is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the center, the object is farther from the center at the equator, resulting in less gravitational pull and lower weight.\n2. **Earth's Rotation:** The rotation of the Earth produces a centrifugal force that acts outward, opposing the force of gravity. This effect is maximum at the equator and zero at the poles. This outward force slightly reduces the net downward force (weight) at the equator."

Any small distortion can usually be corrected, resulting in a clearer, higher-quality signal.\n2. **Easier Data Processing and Storage:** Digital data can be easily stored, processed, compressed, and encrypted by computers and other digital devices, which is very difficult to do with continuous analog signals."

Unsaturated hydrocarbons (alkenes and alkynes) contain at least one double or triple bond between carbon atoms.\n2. **Chemical Reactivity:** Unsaturated hydrocarbons are generally more reactive than saturated ones because the double or triple bonds can be broken to add other atoms (addition reactions).

          "marks": 2,
          "sampleAnswer": "1. **Climate Regulation:** Large bodies of water like oceans can absorb a vast amount of heat from the sun without a significant rise in temperature. This helps in moderating the climate of nearby coastal areas, keeping them cooler in summer and warmer in winter.\n2. **Cooling Agent:** Due to its ability to absorb a lot of heat with only a small temperature change, water is an excellent cooling agent. It is used in car radiators and industrial processes to prevent engines and machinery from overheating."

          "marks": 4,
          "sampleAnswer": "**Pascal's Law:**\nPascal's law states that a pressure change at any point in a confined incompressible fluid is transmitted equally to all points throughout the fluid.\n\n**Application in Hydraulic Lift:**\nA hydraulic lift consists of two pistons of different cross-sectional areas (a small area A₁ and a large area A₂) connected by a container filled with an incompressible fluid. When a small force (F₁) is applied to the small piston, it creates a pressure (P = F₁/A₁). According to Pascal's law, this pressure is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid and acts on the larger piston. This pressure on the larger piston produces a much larger upward force (F₂ = P × A₂). Since A₂ is much larger than A₁, the output force F₂ is much larger than the input force F₁, allowing heavy objects to be lifted.\n\n**Calculation:**\nGiven:\nForce on small piston (F₁) = 50 N\nArea of small piston (A₁) = 2 cm²\nArea of large piston (A₂) = 100 cm²\nForce on large piston (F₂) = ?\n\nFirst, find the pressure exerted on the small piston:\nP = F₁ / A₁ = 50 N / 2 cm² = 25 N/cm²\n\nThis pressure is transmitted to the large piston. So, the force on the large piston is:\nF₂ = P × A₂\nF₂ = 25 N/cm² × 100 cm²\nF₂ = **2500 N**"

          "marks": 4,
          "sampleAnswer": "**Causes of Myopia:**\nMyopia, or short-sightedness, is a defect of vision where a person can see nearby objects clearly but distant objects appear blurry. This occurs when the eye focuses images in front of the retina instead of on the retina. The two main causes are:\n1.  **Elongated Eyeball:** The eyeball is too long from front to back. This increased distance causes the light rays from distant objects to converge at a point before they reach the retina.\n2.  **High Converging Power of the Eye Lens:** The cornea or the eye lens has too much curvature, causing it to be too powerful. This makes the lens bend light rays too strongly, so they focus in front of the retina.\n\n**Correction of Myopia:**\nMyopia is corrected by using a **concave lens**. A concave lens is a diverging lens, which means it spreads out the light rays before they enter the eye. This divergence counteracts the excessive convergence of the eye's lens. The concave lens is chosen with the appropriate power (focal length) so that it diverges the parallel light rays from a distant object just enough for the eye's lens to then converge them perfectly onto the retina, forming a clear image."

          "sampleAnswer": "1.  **Basis of Atomic Number:** The modern periodic table is based on the modern periodic law, which arranges elements in increasing order of their atomic numbers, not atomic mass. This provides a more fundamental and accurate classification.\n2.  **Periods and Groups:** The table is organized into 7 horizontal rows called periods and 18 vertical columns called groups. Elements in the same period have the same number of electron shells, while elements in the same group have the same number of valence electrons and thus similar chemical properties.\n3.  **Blocks (s, p, d, f):** The elements are divided into four blocks—s, p, d, and f—based on the subshell into which the last electron enters. This classification helps in understanding the electronic configuration and properties of the elements more systematically.\n4.  **Systematic Placement of Elements:** It provides a clear separation of metals, non-metals, and metalloids. Metals are located on the left side, non-metals on the right, and metalloids along the dividing zigzag line. It also places noble gases, lanthanides, and actinides in separate, logical positions."

The alleles for blood groups are Iᴬ (for A), Iᴮ (for B), and i (for O). Iᴬ and Iᴮ are codominant, and both are dominant over the recessive allele 'i'.\n\n**Parental Genotypes:**\nFor this to be possible, the parent with blood group 'A' must have the genotype **Iᴬi**. The parent with blood group 'B' must have the genotype **Iᴮi**.\n\n**Gametes Produced:**\n* Parent A (Iᴬi) will produce two types of gametes: **Iᴬ** and **i**.\n* Parent B (Iᴮi) will produce two types of gametes: **Iᴮ** and **i**.\n\n**Checkerboard (Punnett Square):**\nWe can show the possible combinations of genotypes for their children using a checkerboard:\n\n| Gametes from Parent B | Iᴮ | i |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Gametes from Parent A** | | |\n| **Iᴬ** | IᴬIᴮ (AB) | Iᴬi (A) |\n| **i** | Iᴮi (B) | ii (O) |\n\n**Explanation:**\nAs shown in the checkerboard, there are four possible genotypes for the offspring:\n* IᴬIᴮ (Blood Group AB)\n* Iᴬi (Blood Group A)\n* Iᴮi (Blood Group B)\n* **ii (Blood Group O)**\n\nTherefore, there is a 25% probability that the child will inherit the recessive 'i' allele from both heterozygous parents, resulting in the genotype 'ii', which corresponds to blood group 'O'."

Some crops may fail due to lack of water or excessive heat, while new pests and diseases may emerge, leading to an overall decrease in agricultural productivity.\n2.  **Increased Soil Erosion and Landslides:** More frequent and intense rainfall events accelerate soil erosion from farmlands, washing away fertile topsoil. This reduces soil fertility and can trigger landslides, destroying agricultural land.\n\n**Effects on Water Resources:**\n1.  **Glacier Melting and GLOFs:** Rising temperatures are causing rapid melting of Himalayan glaciers, which are a primary source of water for Nepal's rivers. In the short term, this increases water flow, but in the long term, it threatens water security. It also increases the risk of Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs), which can cause catastrophic damage downstream.\n2.  **Impact on Water Availability:** Changes in monsoon patterns lead to more erratic water availability. There are longer dry spells, reducing water levels in rivers and springs, which affects drinking water supply, irrigation, and the generation of hydroelectricity, a cornerstone of Nepal's economy."

The induced current lasts as long as the change in magnetic flux continues.\n\n**Device based on this principle:**\nA device based on electromagnetic induction is an **Electric Generator** (or Dynamo).\n\n**Ways to increase the amount of induced current:**\n1.  **Increase the speed of rotation:** By rotating the coil faster within the magnetic field (or moving the magnet faster), the rate of change of magnetic flux is increased, which induces a larger current.\n2.  **Increase the strength of the magnetic field:** Using a stronger magnet creates a more dense magnetic field. This means more magnetic field lines are cut by the coil per unit time, resulting in a larger induced current.\n*(Other valid answers include: Increase the number of turns in the coil; Use a soft iron core inside the coil.)*"

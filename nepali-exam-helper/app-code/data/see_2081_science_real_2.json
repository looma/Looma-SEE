          "sampleAnswer": "This is due to two reasons:\n1. **Shape of the Earth:** The Earth is not a perfect sphere; it is slightly flattened at the poles and bulged at the equator. This means the polar radius is shorter than the equatorial radius. Since 'g' is inversely proportional to the square of the radius (g ∝ 1/R²), the smaller radius at the poles results in a higher value of 'g'.\n2. **Rotation of the Earth:** The Earth's rotation creates a centrifugal force that acts outwards, opposing gravity. This force is maximum at the equator and zero at the poles. Therefore, the effective value of 'g' is slightly reduced at the equator compared to the poles."

          "marks": 2,
          "sampleAnswer": "The reaction will take place faster in **Beaker A**.\n**Reason:** The rate of a chemical reaction generally increases with an increase in temperature. The higher temperature (30°C) in Beaker A gives the reactant particles more kinetic energy, causing them to collide more frequently and with greater force, which leads to a faster reaction rate compared to the lower temperature (20°C) in Beaker B."

          "sampleAnswer": "**Mendel's Law of Segregation:**\nThis law states that during the formation of gametes (eggs or sperm), the two alleles for a heritable character separate or segregate from each other, so that each gamete ends up with only one allele for that character.\n\n**Explanation with a Monohybrid Cross:**\nLet's consider a cross between a pure tall pea plant (TT) and a pure dwarf pea plant (tt). 'T' is the allele for tallness and 't' is for dwarfness.\n\n1.  **Parental (P) Generation:** The tall plant has the genotype TT, and the dwarf plant has tt.\n\n2.  **Gamete Formation (P):** According to the law of segregation, the alleles separate. The tall plant (TT) produces only gametes with the 'T' allele. The dwarf plant (tt) produces only gametes with the 't' allele.\n\n3.  **First (F₁) Generation:** When these gametes fuse, all offspring have the genotype Tt. Phenotypically, all are tall because 'T' is dominant.\n\n4.  **Gamete Formation (F₁):** Now, when the F₁ plant (Tt) forms gametes, the law of segregation applies again. The two alleles, 'T' and 't', separate from each other. Thus, the F₁ plant produces two types of gametes in equal proportions: 50% with the 'T' allele and 50% with the 't' allele.\n\n5.  **Second (F₂) Generation:** The random fusion of these gametes during self-pollination results in offspring with genotypes TT, Tt, and tt in a 1:2:1 ratio. This demonstrates that the alleles were segregated into separate gametes and did not blend, allowing the recessive trait (dwarfness) to reappear in the F₂ generation."

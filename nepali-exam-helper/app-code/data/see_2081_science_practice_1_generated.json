Non-renewable energy sources are finite and cannot be replenished within a human lifespan, as they take millions of years to form (e.g., fossil fuels like coal, petroleum).\n2. **Environmental Impact:** Renewable energy sources are generally cleaner and have a lower environmental impact, producing few or no greenhouse gases. Non-renewable energy sources, when burned, release significant amounts of greenhouse gases and other pollutants, contributing to climate change and air pollution."

          "marks": 4,
          "sampleAnswer": "Protein digestion is a chemical process that begins in the stomach and is completed in the small intestine.\n\n**In the Stomach:**\nWhen food containing protein enters the stomach, the gastric glands are stimulated to release gastric juice. Gastric juice contains inactive pepsinogen and hydrochloric acid (HCl).\n1.  **Activation:** Hydrochloric acid creates a highly acidic environment (pH 1.5-3.5) which kills most bacteria and activates pepsinogen into its active form, pepsin.\n2.  **Digestion:** Pepsin is a protease enzyme that begins the breakdown of large, complex protein molecules into smaller polypeptide chains and proteoses.\n\n**In the Small Intestine:**\nThe partially digested food (chyme) moves from the stomach into the duodenum (the first part of the small intestine). Here, two main secretions continue protein digestion:\n1.  **Pancreatic Juice:** The pancreas releases pancreatic juice containing inactive proteases: trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen. In the duodenum, an enzyme called enterokinase activates trypsinogen into trypsin. Trypsin then digests proteins further and also activates chymotrypsinogen into chymotrypsin. Both trypsin and chymotrypsin break down the polypeptides into smaller peptides.\n2.  **Intestinal Juice (Succus Entericus):** The walls of the small intestine secrete intestinal juice containing enzymes called peptidases (like erepsin). These enzymes complete the final step of digestion by breaking down the small peptides into their individual building blocks, amino acids. These amino acids are then small enough to be absorbed through the intestinal walls into the bloodstream."

          "sampleAnswer": "In an ecosystem, biotic (living) and abiotic (non-living) factors are deeply interconnected and interdependent. Biotic components rely on abiotic factors for survival, and in turn, influence the state of these abiotic factors.\n\n**Example 1: Plants and Abiotic Factors**\nA plant (biotic factor) depends on several abiotic factors for its survival. It requires sunlight (abiotic) for photosynthesis, water (abiotic) from the soil for metabolic processes, carbon dioxide (abiotic) from the air, and nutrients (abiotic, e.g., nitrogen, phosphorus) from the soil. In turn, the plant affects the abiotic environment. Through photosynthesis, it releases oxygen, changing the composition of the atmosphere. Its roots help hold the soil together, preventing erosion, and upon death, its decomposition returns organic matter and nutrients to the soil.\n\n**Example 2: Animals and Water**\nAnimals (biotic factor) need water (abiotic factor) for drinking, regulating body temperature, and as a habitat (for aquatic animals). The availability of water in an area directly determines the types and number of animals that can survive there. In turn, animals can affect water bodies. For instance, animals like beavers build dams, which significantly alters the flow of rivers and creates new pond ecosystems. Waste products from animals can also add nutrients like nitrogen to water sources, affecting water quality."

          "marks": 4,
          "sampleAnswer": "Heredity is the passing of traits from parents to their offspring. This process is fundamentally controlled by chromosomes and genes located within the nucleus of our cells.\n\n**Role of Chromosomes:**\nChromosomes are thread-like structures made of protein and a single molecule of DNA. They act as the primary carriers or vehicles of genetic information. Humans have 46 chromosomes in each somatic cell, arranged in 23 pairs. One chromosome from each pair is inherited from each parent. Chromosomes ensure that the vast amount of genetic information in DNA is organized, managed, and accurately distributed to new cells during cell division (mitosis) and to offspring during reproduction (meiosis).\n\n**Role of Genes:**\nA gene is a specific segment of the DNA molecule on a chromosome. It is the basic physical and functional unit of heredity. Each gene contains the instructions, in the form of a chemical code, to synthesize a specific protein or functional RNA molecule. These proteins then determine the specific traits or characteristics of an organism, such as eye color, height, blood type, and susceptibility to certain diseases. Different versions of the same gene are called alleles. The combination of alleles inherited from both parents determines the final expressed trait in the offspring. Therefore, genes are the actual 'blueprints' for traits, while chromosomes are the 'books' that carry these blueprints."

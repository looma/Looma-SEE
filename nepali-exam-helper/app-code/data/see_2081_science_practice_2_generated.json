          "marks": 2,
          "sampleAnswer": "The weight of an object decreases for two main reasons:\n1. **Earth's Shape:** The Earth is not a perfect sphere; it is slightly flattened at the poles and bulges at the equator. This means the equatorial radius is greater than the polar radius. Since gravity (and thus weight) is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the center, the object is farther from the center at the equator, resulting in less gravitational pull and lower weight.\n2. **Earth's Rotation:** The rotation of the Earth produces a centrifugal force that acts outward, opposing the force of gravity. This effect is maximum at the equator and zero at the poles. This outward force slightly reduces the net downward force (weight) at the equator."

Any small distortion can usually be corrected, resulting in a clearer, higher-quality signal.\n2. **Easier Data Processing and Storage:** Digital data can be easily stored, processed, compressed, and encrypted by computers and other digital devices, which is very difficult to do with continuous analog signals."

Unsaturated hydrocarbons (alkenes and alkynes) contain at least one double or triple bond between carbon atoms.\n2. **Chemical Reactivity:** Unsaturated hydrocarbons are generally more reactive than saturated ones because the double or triple bonds can be broken to add other atoms (addition reactions). Saturated hydrocarbons primarily undergo substitution reactions."

This helps in moderating the climate of nearby coastal areas, keeping them cooler in summer and warmer in winter.\n2. **Cooling Agent:** Due to its ability to absorb a lot of heat with only a small temperature change, water is an excellent cooling agent. It is used in car radiators and industrial processes to prevent engines and machinery from overheating."

          "sampleAnswer": "**Mendel's Law of Segregation:**\nThis law states that during the formation of gametes (eggs or sperm), the two alleles for a heritable character separate or segregate from each other, so that each gamete ends up with only one allele for that character.\n\n**Explanation with a Monohybrid Cross:**\nLet's consider a cross between a pure tall pea plant (TT) and a pure dwarf pea plant (tt). 'T' is the allele for tallness and 't' is for dwarfness.\n\n1.  **Parental (P) Generation:** The tall plant has the genotype TT, and the dwarf plant has tt.\n\n2.  **Gamete Formation (P):** According to the law of segregation, the alleles separate. The tall plant (TT) produces only gametes with the 'T' allele. The dwarf plant (tt) produces only gametes with the 't' allele.\n\n3.  **First (F₁) Generation:** When these gametes fuse, all offspring have the genotype Tt. Phenotypically, all are tall because 'T' is dominant.\n\n4.  **Gamete Formation (F₁):** Now, when the F₁ plant (Tt) forms gametes, the law of segregation applies again. The two alleles, 'T' and 't', separate from each other. Thus, the F₁ plant produces two types of gametes in equal proportions: 50% with the 'T' allele and 50% with the 't' allele.\n\n5.  **Second (F₂) Generation:** The random fusion of these gametes during self-pollination results in offspring with genotypes TT, Tt, and tt in a 1:2:1 ratio. This demonstrates that the alleles were segregated into separate gametes and did not blend, allowing the recessive trait (dwarfness) to reappear in the F₂ generation."

Obesity also significantly increases the risk as the heart has to pump harder to supply blood to the excess tissue.\n\n**Preventive Measures:**\n1.  **Adopt a Healthy Diet:** Reduce salt intake and consume a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins (like the DASH diet). This helps in naturally lowering blood pressure and maintaining a healthy weight.\n2.  **Regular Physical Exercise:** Engaging in at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (like brisk walking, jogging, or swimming) most days of the week helps strengthen the heart, improve blood circulation, and maintain a healthy weight, all of which contribute to lowering blood pressure."

Their number is the largest in the ecosystem, forming a broad base for the pyramid.\n\n* **Primary Consumers:** The next trophic level consists of primary consumers (herbivores) that feed on the grass, such as grasshoppers, rabbits, and deer. The total number of these herbivores is less than the number of grass plants.\n\n* **Secondary Consumers:** Above the primary consumers are the secondary consumers (carnivores) that feed on the herbivores, such as frogs, lizards, or foxes.

It is passed through a drying tower containing lumps of quicklime (calcium oxide, CaO). The function of the lime tower is to dry the ammonia gas. Quicklime is used because it is a basic oxide and does not react with ammonia, which is a basic gas. Drying agents like concentrated H₂SO₄ or anhydrous CaCl₂ cannot be used as they react with ammonia.\n\n**Uses of Ammonia:**\n1.  **Manufacturing Fertilizers:** A major use of ammonia is in the production of nitrogenous fertilizers, such as ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulphate, and urea, which are essential for agriculture.\n2.  **As a Refrigerant:** Ammonia has a high latent heat of vaporization, making it an efficient refrigerant.
